//STATIC DATA STRUCTURE
//make an array of strings 
//at bat cat fat hat mat pat cannot add more to the array because it is fixed size
//in order to add to the existing array you have to create a new array, you want to double it and make it more efficient
//array is static

//DYNAMIC DATA STRUCTURE
//at will have a pointer to another pointer to an object and so on
//no need to create a new array, you can just create the object and make a pointer point to it (node objects)
